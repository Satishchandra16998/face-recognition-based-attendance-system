# face-recognition-based-attendance-system
Detecting facial features (e.g. eye corners) on images is an important task for many computer vision applications like face recognition, facial expression recognition, tracking, and 3D face modeling from 2D images. Some of the current methods to detect facial keypoints are based on sophisticated classifiers. This project proposes a purely data-driven approach based on template matching.
Face recognition is a non-invasive identiﬁcation system and faster than other systems since multiple faces can be analysed at the same time. The diﬀerence between face detection and identiﬁcation is, face detection is to identify a face from an image and locate the face. Face recognition is making the decision ”whose face is it ? ”, using an image database. In this project both are accomplished using diﬀerent techniques and are described below. The report begins with a brief history of face recognition. This is followed by the explanation of HAAR-cascades, Eigenface, Fisherface and Local binary pattern histogram (LBPH) algorithms. Next, the methodology and the results of the project are described. A discussion regarding the challenges and the resolutions are described. Finally, a conclusion is provided on the pros and cons of each algorithm and possible implementation.
